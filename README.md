# Healthcare-predictive-modeling-using-Machine-learning
This project aims to develop robust machine learning models for the early detection of Parkinsonâ€™s disease and the prediction of chronic kidney disease and liver disease using Python, JupyterLab for code
development, PyCaret for model building, and XGBoost as one of the frameworks. Early detection and
prediction of medical conditions using AI can lead to timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.
